The sun was shining brightly in the clear blue sky as I walked down the busy street, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling city.
People hurried past me, their arms full of shopping bags and their faces obscured by masks. I couldn't help but wonder where they were headed, what their stories were.
As I turned the corner, I caught a whiff of freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby bakery. My stomach rumbled with hunger and I decided to pop in for a quick bite.
The warm bread was delicious and I savored each bite, watching the world go by outside.
Eventually, I finished my snack and headed back out into the busy streets, ready to face whatever the day had in store for me.
